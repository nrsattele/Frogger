# Frogger

Who doesn't love frogger?! For my final project junior year of high school, I developed this.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, build, and run class MAIN. You could also just double click on Frogger.jar.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Java installed. [Find it here](https://java.com/en/ "Java")

### Installing

You may have to add the jdk to your classpath (It's probably at c:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x\bin)

Open powershell or whatever you use. Navigate to the src directory of this repository.

Compile `javac *.java`

Run `java MAIN`
